\begin{slide}{What is software architecture?}

The \dkb{architecture} of a system describes its gross structure which illuminates the top level design decisions, namely

\begin{itemize}
\item how is it \dgold{composed} and of which \dgold{interacting parts}?
\item where are the \dgold{pathways of interaction}?
\item which are the \dgold{key properties} of the parts the architecture rely and/or enforce?
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


\begin{slide}{What is software architecture?}
A framework to perform early verification of a system and ensure composability of separately  developed parts, providing

\begin{itemize}
\item \dkb{structural} \emph{vs} \dkb{behavioural} views
\item \dkb{hierarchical} decomposition into interacting entities
\item \dkb{functional} \emph{vs} \dkb{non functional} properties
\\ (e.g. performance, reliability, dependability, portability, scalability, interoperability ...)
\\ to analyse schedulability, flow latency, memory consumption
\item \dkb{design guidelines} (e.g. binding threads to processors to make the system schedulable)
\item models for \dkb{adaptation} and \dkb{reconfigurability}
\item ...
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}



\begin{slide}{What is software architecture?}

\begin{block}{\fbox{Which structure? $\leadsto\;$ Architectural views}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \dkb{code-based structures}: such as \dkb{modules}, \dkb{classes}, \dkb{packages} and relationships like \dkb{uses}, \dkb{inherits from} or \dkb{depends on}.
\item \dkb{\underline{run-time structures}}: such as \dkb{object instances}, \dkb{clients}, \dkb{servers}, \dkb{databases},  \dkb{browsers}, \dkb{channels}, \dkb{broadcasters}, \dkb{software buses}, ...
\item \dkb{allocation structures}: intended to map code-based and run-time structures to external items, such as \dkb{network locations}, \dkb{physical devices}, \dkb{managerial structures} ...
\end{itemize}
\caixa{This course 
\begin{itemize}
\item  focus on \dkb{run-time structures}

\begin{slide}{Two examples}

~\\~\\~\\
\begin{center}
\texttt{cat invoices |  grep  january  | sort} 
\end{center}
~\\~\\
\begin{itemize}
\item
Application architecture can be understood based on very few rules
\item
Applications can be composed by non-programmers 
\item
... a simple architectural concept that can be comprehended and applied by a broad audience
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}



\begin{slide}{Two examples}
\fbox{to the \dkb{macro} level (the WWW architecture)}
~\\~\\
\begin{itemize}
\item
Architecture is totally  separated from the code
\item
There is no single piece of code that implements the architecture
\item
There are multiple pieces of code that implement the various components of the architecture
(e.g., different  browsers)
\item
One of the most successful applications is only understood adequately from an architectural  point of view
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}



\begin{slide}{Architectural styles (or patterns)}


An architectural style consists of:
\begin{itemize}
\item a set of component types (e.g., process, procedure) that perform some function at runtime
\item  a topological layout of the components showing their runtime relationships
\item a set of semantic constraints (e.g. a layer may only talk to its adjacent)
\item a set of connectors (e.g., data streams, sockets) that mediate communication among components
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}



\begin{slide}{Architectural styles (or patterns)}
\begin{itemize}
\item classify families of software architectures
\item act as \dkb{types} for \dkb{configurations}
\item provide
\begin{itemize}
\item \dkb{domain-specific design vocabulary} (eg, set of connector and component types admissible)
\item a set of \dkb{constraints} to single out which configurations are well-formed. Eg, a pipeline architecture might constraint valid configurations to be linear sequences of pipes and filters.
\item guidance for architectural design based on the \dkb{problem domain} and the \dkb{deployment context}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Examples}
\begin{itemize}
\item \dkb{Layers}
\item \dkb{Client \& Server}
\item \dkb{Master \& Slave}
\item \dkb{Publish \& Subscribe}
\item \dkb{Peer2Peer}
\item \dkb{Pipes and Filters}
\item \dkb{Event-bus}
\item \dkb{Repositories}
\begin{itemize}
\item triggering by transactions: \dkb{databases}
\item triggering by current state: \dkb{blackboard}
\end{itemize}
\item \dkb{Table-driven} (virtual machines)
\item ...
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


\begin{slide}{Pattern: Layers}
\begin{itemize}
\item helps to structure applications that can be decomposed into groups of subtasks at different levels of abstraction
\item Layer $n$ provides services to  layer $n+1$ implementing them through services of the layer $n+1$
\item Typically, service requests resort to synchronous procedure calls
\end{itemize}
~\\~\\
\begin{block}{Examples:}
\dkb{virtual machines} (eg, JVM)\\
\dkb{APIs} (eg, C standard library on top of Unix system calls)\\
\dkb{operating systems} (eg, Windows NT microkernel)\\
\dkb{networking protocols} (eg, ISO OSI 7-layer model; TCP/IP)
\end{block}
\end{slide}


\begin{slide}{Pattern: Client-Server}
\begin{itemize}
\item permanently active servers supporting multiple clients
\item requests typically handled in separate threads
\item stateless (session state maintained by the client) vs stateful servers
\item interaction by some inter-process communication mechanism
\end{itemize}
~\\~\\
\begin{block}{Examples:}
\dkb{remote DB access}\\
\dkb{web-based applications}\\
\dkb{interactive shells} 
\end{block}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Pattern: Peer-2-Peer}
\begin{itemize}
\item symmetric Client-Service pattern
\item peers may change roles dynamically
\item services can be implicit (eg, through the use of a data stream)
\end{itemize}
~\\~\\
\begin{block}{Examples:}
\dkb{multi-user applications}\\
 \dkb{P2P file sharing} \\
\end{block}
\end{slide}



\begin{slide}{Pattern: Publish-Subscribe}
\begin{itemize}
\item used to structure distributed systems whose components interact through remote service invocations
\item servers publish their capabilities (services + characteristics) to a \dkb{broker} component, which accepts client requests and coordinate communication
\item allows dynamic reconfiguration
\item requires standardisation of service descriptions through IDL (eg CORBA IDL, .Net, WSDL) or
a binary standard (eg, Microsoft OLE --- methods are called indirectly using pointers)
\end{itemize}
~\\~\\
\begin{block}{Examples:}
\dkb{web services}\\
 \dkb{CORBA} (for cooperation among heterogeneous OO systems) \\
\end{block}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Pattern: Master-Slave}
\begin{itemize}
\item a master component distributes work load to similar slave components and computes a final result from the results these slaves return
\item isolated slaves; no sharing of data
\item supports fault-tolerance and parallel computation
\end{itemize}
~\\~\\
\begin{block}{Examples:}
\dkb{dependable systems} 
\end{block}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Pattern: Event-Bus}
\begin{itemize}
\item event sources publish messages to particular channels on an event bus
\item event listeners subscribe to particular channels  and are notified of message availability
\item asynchronous interaction
\item channels can be implicit (eg, using event patterns)
\item allows dynamic reconfiguration
\item variant of so-called \dkb{event-driven} architectures
\end{itemize}
~\\~\\
\begin{block}{Examples:}
\dkb{process monitoring} \\
\dkb{trading systems}
\end{block}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Pattern: Pipe \& Filter}
\begin{itemize}
\item suitable for data stream processing
\item each processing step is encapsulated into a filter component
\item uniform data format
\item no shared state
\item concurrent processing is natural
\end{itemize}
~\\~\\
\begin{block}{Examples:}
\dkb{compilers} \\
\dkb{Unix shell commands}
\end{block}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Pattern: Blackboard}
\begin{itemize}
\item suitable for problems with non deterministic solution strategy known
\item all components have access to a shared data store
\item components feed the blackboard and inspect it for new partial data
\item extending the data space is easy, but changing its structure may be hard
\end{itemize}
~\\~\\
\begin{block}{Examples:}
\dkb{complex IA problems} (eg, planning, machine learning) \\
\dkb{complex applications in computing science} (eg, speech recognition; computational chemistry)
\end{block}
\end{slide}


%\section{Evolution \& Challenges}
%

\begin{slide}{Software Architecture as a discipline}
\begin{itemize}
\item Until the 90's, SA was largely an \dkb{ad hoc affair} \\ (but see [Dijkstra,69], [Parnas79], ...)
\item Descriptions relied on informal box-and-line diagrams, rarely maintained once the system was built
\end{itemize}
\begin{block}{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item recognition of a shared \dkb{repertoire} of methods, techniques and patterns for structuring complex systems
\item quest for \dkb{reusable frameworks} for the development of product families
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{The last 15 years}
\begin{itemize}
\item Formal notations for representing and analysing SA: \dkb{ADL}
\item \dkb{Examples}: Wright, Rapide, SADL, Darwin, C2, Aesop, Piccola, AADL\\~\\
\caixapeq{ADLs provide:
\begin{itemize}
\item \dkb{conceptual framework} + \dkb{concrete syntax}
\item \dkb{tools} for parsing, displaying, analysing or simulating architectural descriptions
\end{itemize}
}\\~\\
\item \textsc{Acme} [Garlan et al, 97] as an architectural \dkb{interchange} language (a sort of
XML for architectural description)
\item Use of model-based prototyping tools (eg Z, VDM) or model-checkers (eg Alloy) to 
\dkb{analyse} architectural descriptions
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}


\begin{slide}{The last 15 years}
\begin{itemize}
\item Classification of \dkb{architectural styles} characterising \dkb{families} of SA and acting as \dkb{types} for configurations
\item \dkb{Standardisation} efforts: ANSI/IEEE Std 1471-2000, but also 'local' standards (eg, Sun's Enterprise JavaBeans architecture)
\item Impact of the emergence of a \dkb{general purpose (object-oriented) design notation} --- UML ---
closer to practitioners and with a direct link to OO implementations
\item SA becomes a mature discipline in Software Engineering; new fields include \dkb{documentation} and  \dkb{architectural recovery} from legacy code
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Current trends}

\begin{block}{\rdb{Everyware everywhere}}
\begin{itemize}
\item \dkb{Everyware} products
\item vs \dkb{everywhere} development:\\ many companies look at themselves more as system \dkb{integrators} rather than as software \dkb{developers}:
~\\~\\
\caixapeq{
the code they write is \dkb{glue} code ...\\
which entails the need for common frameworks to reduce \dkb{architectural mismatchs} }
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{slide}

\begin{slide}{Current trends}
\begin{block}{ From \rdb{object-oriented} to \rdb{component-based}}
\begin{center}
\caixa{\small
\begin{itemize}
\item In OO the architecture is \dkb{implicit}: source code exposes 
\dkb{class hierarchies} but not the \dkb{run-time interaction}
\item Objects are wired at a very low level and the description of the wiring patterns
is distributed among them
\item CBD retains the basic encapsulation of \dkb{data} and \dkb{code} principle to increase modularity
but shifts the emphasis from \dkb{class inheritance} to \dkb{object composition}
\item ... to avoid interference between inheritance and encapsulation
and pave the way to a development methodology based on \dkb{third-party assembly} of
components
\end{itemize}

'not only the complexity of building a large application that one needs to deliver, in time and budget, to a client, but of managing an \dkb{open-ended
structure of autonomous components, possibly distributed and highly heterogeneous}.\\
This means developing software components that are autonomous and can be interconnected
with other components, software or otherwise, and \dkb{managing the interconnections
themselves} as new components may be required to join in and others to be
removed.'\\

\section{The Course's Approach}
\begin{slide}{Challenges}
Such trends entails a number of challenges to the way we think about SA

\begin{itemize}
\item new \dkb{target}: need for an architectural discipline for \rdb{reactive systems}\\
(often \dkb{complex}, \dkb{time critical}, \dkb{mobile}, \dkb{cyber-physical}, etc ...) 
\item from  \dkb{composition}  to \rdb{coordination} (orchestration)
%\pause
\item relevance of \dkb{wrappers} and component \dkb{adapters}: integration \emph{vs} incompatible assumptions about component interaction
%~\\
%\caixapeq{
%'many resources cannot be smoothly integrated because they make incompatible assumptions about component interaction (...) Eg, it is hard to integrate a component packaged to interact via rpc, to
%another prepared to interact via shared data in  a proprietary trepresentation'\\
%(Garlan, 06)
%}
\item \dkb{reconfigurability}
\item  continued \rdb{interaction} as  a first-class citizen and the main form of software composition
\end{itemize}
\end{slide}



%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{slide}{Reactive systems}
\small
\begin{block}{Reactive system}
\caixa{system that computes by reacting to stimuli from its environment along its overall computation}
\end{block}
\begin{itemize}
\item in contrast to sequential systems whose meaning is defined by the results of finite computations, the behaviour of reactive systems is mainly determined by \dkb{interaction} and \dkb{mobility} of \dkb{non-terminating} processes, 
evolving \dkb{concurrently}.
\item \dkb{observation} $\; \equiv\;$ interaction
\item \dkb{behaviour} $\; \equiv\;$ a structured record of interactions

\begin{align*}

& \mathsf{x := x+1\mid x := x+2}
\end{align*}
\end{block}
\begin{itemize}
\item both statements in \dgold{parallel} could read $x$ before it is written 
\item which values can $x$ take?
\item which is the program outcome if \dgold{exclusive access} to memory and \dgold{atomic execution}

%\begin{slide}{The challenge}
%Software Architecture is  challenged by the continuous evolution towards very large, heterogeneous, highly dynamic computing systems, whose behaviour  cannot be  characterized in terms of a io-relation In most cases, such a behaviour
%\begin{itemize}

%\item  expresses a \dkb{continued interaction} with the system's environment and sub-systems which execute

%\begin{slide}{Our approach}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \dkb{Time-critical systems}, i.e., systems whose design correctness is assessed not only in terms of the logical result of computation but also depends on the time at which such results are produced.

%\item \dkb{Service-oriented applications}.  Services are dynamic entities, running on different platforms often owned by different organisations, interacting through public interfaces, and typically remaining loosely coupled, if not utterly unaware of each other. Open, dynamic reconfigurable and evolutive structure.
